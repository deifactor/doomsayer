# doomsayer

`doomsayer` is a bot for posting a list of words to Mastodon, one at a time,
until it runs out. The intent is that you run it in a cron job.

## What's up with the name?

The quintessential such account is
[@everyword@twitter.com](https://twitter.com/everyword), and when I plugged
'every mastodon' into [the anagram
engine](https://new.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=every+mastodon&language=english&t=500&d=2&include=&exclude=&n=&m=&a=n&l=n&q=n&k=1),
the word 'doomsayer' stuck out at me. Also, it's just a cool word.
